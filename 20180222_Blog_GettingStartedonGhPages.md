# Taking a step back and being critical

#### I have no quotes for this post but I recommend reading the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. It was first published in 1936 but the wealth of information obtained from reading it is invaluable and timeless. If you do decide to pick it up, read slow and reflect after every chapter.

We're still in business folks! I am back from a month (half of a month more accurately) filled with unique and interesting experiences. I have been exploring myself, the people around me and applying every piece of valuable knowledge handed to me. Let's just say that my birthday passed around that time period and I almost forgot about it. Yeah! No biggie! My birthday week was enjoyable on smaller scale and I wouldn't have traded the people I've shared it with with anyone else. Some people couldn't make it for valid reasons, spiritually you were there with me and I include you all in my sentiments.

At this point in my life being super focused on things I want to get done. I realize now that I should take it at a pace to which I can enjoy the journey. This is something I've been putting into practice for the past couple of weeks. It still requires me to be a time management freak but after putting the plans into motion they stop being plans and just a way of life. Through reading a lot of book on toxic habits that we inflict on ourselves, I've come to sit back and reflect on every activity and interaction I engage with throughout my days.

It takes patience and being selfless to really be critical about your life and your goals. It's already a challenge to figure out who we are, but to then be critical about it and figure out who we want to be is like starting out in the gym with weights that are 5x times what we can handle. Not everyone has the willpower to even train towards reaching self-fulfillment goals and it is much easier push the struggle aside and feel comfortable. Yet, by the end of it, those who put in the effort avoid the permanent scars of regret. Being comfortable comes with the inevitable consequence of boredom. On the other hand, reaching personal goals keeps pushing your mind to strive towards new limits.

To paraphrase a passage from one of the books I read over the past couple of weeks: You can tell almost everything about a person based on where they get their feeling of **"self-importance"**. I think stepping back, reflecting, and being critical about where we get our feeling of importance is a good place to start looking for goals.

# Define Your Success

#### *If personal success is all about the riches, then why do the richest people still have that need to succeed?*

![Bored but confortable](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1940x900/getty_498600343_128289.jpg)

As an aspiring professional programmer, I've always wondered **what it means to be successful** in the field. Does it mean having the most money in the most reputable company? Increasing my job market value sure sounds appealing, but it doesn't inherently bring about the personal satisfaction of fulfilling a dream. I can make a respectable living being a Software Dev at Microsoft, but if I am not interested in the work I do, do I consider myself successful? 

Almost a decade ago I started conversing with a woman who put into focus that she was going to make a successful career in an IT related field. The catch was, she was going through the journey without going to college. It was her dream and she focused on it day in and day out. Without going into detail, fast forward to today, she's working at the **Department of Defense** in the United States as a Systems Administrator and is a DJ as well. **A passionate hobby and a reputable stable job?** Any person looking in from the outside would assume this person would be happy with their life and that they would be set. I don't think anyone would claim that this woman isn't successful if asked. 

Having crossed paths and speaking to her again as recently as of last month, what began as a casual passing conversation became an eye opening moment. The way she was expressing herself I could feel something was just different about her. I'm a very nosy person and I waste no time. Without any moment's waste to ease into the topic, I had already jumped in and asked directly about the her life. She explains to me, that regardless of having her own good looking house she is able to do whatever she likes, she isn't happy. Without having used what she knows to help the world in any way, she feels like she's wasted potential.

Witnessing this person already making sacrifices, taking steps to making major life changes in order to do what she feels is what she's always wanted to do, it was a moment of reaching enlightenment in the making. **We see success as a comparative measurement against the status and wealth of those around us.** It can be, but I truly believe success is different for everyone. It is a personal reflection of our values and what is important to us. Personally, knowing who I want to be and being able to live it out most effectively is what success is to me.

and luxuries it can give sidetrack oneâ€™s desire for a successful life and develop instead a
desire for ease."* Glenn Clark

<!--- Mr. Russell is a great believer in versatility in all creative work. In any physical work he
believes one can work many hours at a time, but in mental, creative work he believes one can
do his best only for two hours at a time on any one subject, but he can work another two
hours on another subject with equal freshness. He therefore sometimes works two hours a
day on each of five different creations, "and in that way I can live five lives at a time," he
says.
He also believes that every man should be master of anything he does, do it in a masterly
manner and love it, no matter what it is, whether hard physical work, menial or boring work,
or inspirational work.
"That was his method of transforming work into play. "
 "The book ... is a means of thought transference only, and
not a creative process until you have made it so by transformation within you. -->

# The Light at the End of the Tunnel


#### *In life, you should learn to pull up your sleeves and make yourself at home with sticks and stones...*

Well the blog is finally up and running! I've gotten most of my project repos up for Difficulty 1 projects.
There's still a lot of work to do, as I have to go back and analyse all the code. Let's not forget that none of the projects are commented out yet.

![My house in a Github Pages style web page...](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nCKkHqlx9dE/maxresdefault.jpg)

Github Pages has been causing me issues so far. I had to find a loophole in order to separate my blog pages from my project pages.
What I've done is create a user Github Pages Website, and followed it up by creatign a project Github Pages for my blog. Then copying the settings site to my project site.
my only issue with this is the redundancy after editting one of the layouts. I'm thinking of maybe simplifying the process, by making each page have it's own specific set of buttons. In this way they won't mirror each other as much.


###### Note: Difficulty 1 projects should be completely done by early saturday morning. I'll see if I can add something to them but no promisses.

###### There are the Difficulty 2 projects on the way! I'm wholeheartedly excited to work on them.

# Getting Started on Github Pages

### The long road ahead...


Well it all begins here on the journey to complete 100 programs before the end of June.
Yes that is right, this is what it's all about! I'm challenging myself to complete this very book!

![alt text](http://www.coderslexicon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ebook-cover.png "Noice")

Well to keep things short and simple for the first blog I guess I should mention my inspiration for it and share a bit of who I am.
I am a Blue Ant and I like to build things. That's basically it...

Nah just kidding I'm just an aspiring programmer looking to get into a programming habit. My main issue after a lot of self evaluation is that I cannot remain consistent if I'm not working on a project with a reasonable goal in sight. After a lot of research on myself and methods I've concluded that starting small and ending big would be the best way.
Fortunately The Programmer Idea Book has a workout plan all laid out for me. On  top of it my creative juices start flowing and I'm motivated to start projects on my own. 
Although my real goals in life will require that I do not forget 

Things I tell myself I need to learn but forget. 
- Markdown
- SQL
- Javascript
- Korean *(Yeah I know...)*
