# The Light at the end of the Tunnel

## MARCH 1st 2018

### *In life, you should learn to pull up your sleeves and make yourself at home with sticks and stones...*

Well the blog is finally up and running! I've gotten most of my project repos up for Difficulty 1 projects.
There's still a lot of work to do, as I have to go back and analyse all the code. Let's not forget that none of the projects are commented out yet.

Github Pages has been causing me issues so far. I had to find a loophole in order to separate my blog pages from my project pages.
What I've done is create a user Github Pages Website, and followed it up by creatign a project Github Pages for my blog. Then copying the settings site to my project site.
my only issue with this is the redundancy after editting one of the layouts. I'm thinking of maybe simplifying the process, by making each page have it's own specific set of buttons. In this way they won't mirror each other as much.


###### Note: Difficulty 1 projects should be completely done by early saturday morning. I'll see if I can add something to them but no promisses.

###### There are the Difficulty 2 projects on the way! I'm wholeheartedly excited to work on them.

# Getting Started on Github Pages

### The long road ahead...


Well it all begins here on the journey to complete 100 programs before the end of June.
Yes that is right, this is what it's all about! I'm challenging myself to complete this very book!

Well to keep things short and simple for the first blog I guess I should mention my inspiration for it and share a bit of who I am.
I am a Blue Ant and I like to build things. That's basically it...

Nah just kidding I'm just an aspiring programmer looking to get into a programming habit. My main issue after a lot of self evaluation is that I cannot remain consistent if I'm not working on a project with a reasonable goal in sight. After a lot of research on myself and methods I've concluded that starting small and ending big would be the best way.
Fortunately The Programmer Idea Book has a workout plan all laid out for me. On  top of it my creative juices start flowing and I'm motivated to start projects on my own. 
Although my real goals in life will require that I do not forget 

Things I tell myself I need to learn but forget. 
- Markdown
- SQL
- Javascript
- Korean *(Yeah I know...)*
